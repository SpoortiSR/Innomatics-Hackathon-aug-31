Assume that you started working with Netfiz as a Junior Data Scientist. For your company, providing better movie recommendations is at its core and, helps improve better user experience and generate more revenue. 

Understand that:

Recommender systems make movie-watching a personalized adventure, delighting users with tailored suggestions based on their tastes.
By predicting user preferences, these systems keep users engaged, driving increased interaction with your platform.
A robust movie recommender system translates to business success. Satisfied users are loyal users, contributing to increased user retention and revenue.
Imagine the excitement of helping users discover their next favorite movie! Later during the internship program, we will ask you to create a cutting-edge movie recommendation system based on a treasure trove of user ratings.
